		The Municipality of Valenzuela acquired the inception of public secondary education in 1968 when Maysan Barrio High School ground by the Barrio Council and upon the direction of then Mayor Geronimo Angeles.

In June 1969, for other Barrio High Schools were organized in the Elementary Schools of Malinta, Marulas Gen.T de Leon and Polo by their respective Barrio Councils, in cooperation with the Municipal Council headed by the Honesto Paras.

On August 12, 1969 by virtue of Municipal Ordinance No. 99, all Barrio High Schools were absorbed by the Municipality and converted into Valenzuela Municipal High School. Mrs. Josefina A. Lizaso, who was appointed Principal by then School Division Superintendent, Felicitas Bernardino of the Division of Bulacan, held office at the Palasan School site Polo.

Maysan National High School gained its autonomy under the leadership of the former DepEd Secretary, Ricardo C. Gloria on October 17, 1997.

Maysan National High School is strategically located along Maysan Road and approximately three kilometers away from the Valenzuela City Hall. It is flanked by the Elementary Building and the former Delamo Carrot Juice Factory. East side of the building strands the Holy Rosary Parish Church, a wet market, and the Maysan Barangay Hall respectively.
